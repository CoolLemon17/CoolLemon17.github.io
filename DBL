<h1><strong>TOP THREE BEST 6TH ANNIVERSERY UNITS IN DRAGON BALL LEGENDS</strong></h1>
<p>The 6th Anniversy introduced lots of characters to <em>Dragon Ball Legends</em>, ranging from a divine being known as "shin" to a fat dragon. Here's a list of the top 3:</p>
<h3><strong>Rage Shenron</strong></h3>
<p>This character has shown to be extremely important in the current meta. Due to the nature of his yellow element typing, he can easily tank most attacks, especially from purple types. Additionally, he can paralyze his oppenets with ease, adding to his toxcity in this meta.</p>
<h3><strong>Legends Limited: SSB Gogeta</strong></h3>
<p>This character is a great counter to anyone with a gauge such as Ultra SS2 Gohan and Ultra UI Goku. The ablity to negate these gauges, added with the fact that he is a yellow element in a purple element metal, adds a lot to his value in the meta. This chracter is a must-have on your teams!</p>
<h3><strong>Ultra SS4 Gogeta</strong></h3>
<p>Despite the many counters to Ultra SS4 Gogeta's kit, the menace still can't be stopped. With his overpowered gauge, double ultimate, and strike and special attack power, this monkey is truly soemthing to dread!</p>
